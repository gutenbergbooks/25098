series, of which this is the first volume, is an attempt to meet a need
that has been felt for several years by parents and physicians, as well
as by teachers, supervisors, and others who are actively interested in
educational and social progress. The need of practical activity, which
for long ages constituted the entire education of mankind, is at last
recognized by the elementary school. It has been introduced in many
places and already results have been attained which demonstrate that it
is possible to introduce practical activity in such a way as to afford
the child a sound development&mdash;physically, intellectually, and
morally&mdash;and at the same time equip him for efficient social
service. The question that is perplexing educators at the present time
is, therefore, not one regarding the value of practical activity, but
rather one of ways and means by which practical activity can be
harnessed to the educational work.</p>

<p>The discovery of the fact that steam is a force that can do work had
to await the invention of machinery by means of which to apply the new
force to industrial processes. The use of practical activity will
likewise necessitate many changes in the educational machinery before
its richest results are realized. Yet the conditions that attend the
introduction of practical activity as a motive power in education are
very different from those that attended the introduction of the use of
steam. In the case of steam the problem was that of applying a new force
to an old work. In the case of practical activity it is a question of
restoring a factor which, from the earliest times until within the last
two or three decades, has operated as a permanent educational force.</p>

<p>The situation that has recently deprived the child of the opportunity
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
to participate in industrial processes is due, as is well known, to the
rapid development of our industrial system. Since the removal of
industrial processes from the home the public has awakened to the fact
that the child is being deprived of one of the most potent educational
influences, and efforts have already been made to restore the
educational factor that was in danger of being lost. This is the
significance of the educational movement at the present time.</p>

<p>As long as a simple organization of society prevailed, the school was
not called upon to take up the practical work; but now society has
become so complex that the use of practical activity is absolutely
essential. Society to-day makes a greater demand than ever before upon
each and all of its members for special skill and knowledge, as well as
for breadth of view. These demands can be met only by such an
improvement in educational facilities as corresponds to the increase in
the social demand. Evidently the school must lay hold of all of the
educational forces within its reach.</p>

<p>In the transitional movement it is not strange that new factors are
being introduced without relation to the educational process as a whole.
The isolation of manual training, sewing, and cooking from the physical,
natural, and social sciences is justifiable only on the ground that the
means of establishing more organic relations are not yet available. To
continue such isolated activities after a way is found of harnessing
them to the educational work is as foolish as to allow steam to expend
itself in moving a locomotive up and down the tracks without regard to
the destiny of the detached train.</p>

<p>This series is an attempt to facilitate the transitional movement in
education which is now taking place by presenting educative materials in
a form sufficiently flexible to be readily adapted to the needs of the
school that has not yet been equipped for manual training, as well as to
the needs of the one that has long recognized practical activity as an
essential factor in its work. Since the experience of the race in
industrial and social processes embodies,
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
better than any other experiences of mankind, those things which at the
same time appeal to the whole nature of the child and furnish him the
means of interpreting the complex processes about him, this experience
has been made the groundwork of the present series.</p>

<p>In order to gain cumulative results of value in explaining our own
institutions, the materials used have been selected from the life of
Aryan peoples. That we are not yet in possession of all the facts
regarding the life of the early Aryans is not considered a sufficient
reason for withholding from the child those facts that we have when they
can be adapted to his use. Information regarding the early stages of
Aryan life is meager. Enough has been established, however, to enable us
to mark out the main lines of progress through the hunting, the fishing,
the pastoral, and the agricultural stages, as well as to present the
chief problems that confronted man in taking the first steps in the use
of metals, and in the establishment of trade. Upon these lines, marked
out by the geologist, the paleontologist, the archæologist, and the
anthropologist, the first numbers of this series are based.</p>

<p>A generalized view of the main steps in the early progress of the
race, which it is thus possible to present, is all that is required for
educational ends. Were it possible to present the subject in detail, it
would be tedious and unprofitable to all save the specialist. To select
from the monotony of the ages that which is most vital, to so present it
as to enable the child to participate in the process by which the race
has advanced, is a work more in keeping with the spirit of the age. To
this end the presentation of the subject is made: First, by means of
questions, which serve to develop the habit of making use of experience
in new situations; second, by narrative, which is employed merely as a
literary device for rendering the subject more available to the child;
and third, by suggestions for practical activities that may be carried
out in hours of work or play, in such a way as to direct into useful
channels energy which when left undirected is apt to express itself in
trivial if not
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
in anti-social forms. No part of a book is more significant to the child
than the illustrations. In preparing the illustrations for this series
as great pains have been taken to furnish the child with ideas that will
guide him in his practical activities as to illustrate the text
itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard V. Brown, the artist who executed the drawings, has been
aided in his search for authentic originals by the late J.&nbsp;W.
Powell, <i>director of the United States Bureau of Ethnology,
Washington, D.C.</i>; by Frederick J. V. Skiff, <i>director of the Field
Columbian Museum, Chicago</i>, and by the author. Ethnological
collections and the best illustrative works on ethnological subjects
scattered throughout the country have been carefully searched for
material.</p>

<p>I wish to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Professor
Dewey for the suggestions he has given me with reference to this series,
and to acknowledge that without the inspiration that has come through
his teaching I should probably never have undertaken a work of this
kind. To Dr. W.&nbsp;I. Thomas, <i>professor of sociology and
anthropology in the University of Chicago</i>, I&nbsp;am indebted for
suggestions upon anthropological phases of many of the subjects
presented. To Dr. S.&nbsp;W. Williston, <i>professor of paleontology in
the University of Chicago</i>, I&nbsp;am indebted for a careful
examination of the book from the standpoint of the paleontologist. Among
the many friends who have given me help and inspiration, I&nbsp;would
mention especially, Professor Ella Flagg Young, <i>of the University of
Chicago</i>; Superintendent F.&nbsp;A. Manny, <i>of the Ethical Culture
Schools, New York City</i>; Mrs. Charlotte W. Williams, <i>of
Chicago</i>; my sister, Miss Elspa M. Dopp, <i>of the State Normal
School, St. Cloud, Minn.</i>; and Mr. W.&nbsp;W. Charters, <i>of the
University of Chicago</i>. To the late Director J.&nbsp;W. Powell, <i>of
the United States Bureau of Ethnology</i>, and to Director Frederick
J.&nbsp;V. Skiff, <i>of the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago</i>,
I&nbsp;am under obligations for courtesies extended which have enabled
me to gain access to illustrative materials.</p>

they flew through the air.</p>

<p>The tiny mammals that lived then were about the size of rats and
mice, but these mammals were not like rats and mice.</p>

were not well fitted for running.</p>

<div class = "child">
<p>Perhaps you have seen the zebra.</p>

<p>If you have, you must have noticed its stripes.</p>

<p>The first horse-like creatures were probably striped in much the same
way.</p>

<p>These animals never ate hay and oats; and, at first, they did not eat
much grass.</p>

<p>There was little, if any, grass at that time.</p>

<p>These horse-like creatures lived on marshes and in swamps bordering
streams and lakes.</p>

<p>They probably ate stems and leaves of plants that grew on the marshy
lands.</p>

<p>They did not run as horses do to-day, but they plodded along on the
soft ground.</p>

<p>They spread out their toes as they walked along, so as to keep from
sinking.</p>

<p>When the dry land began to be covered with grass, little by little
they left the marshes.</p>

<p>They went to the grassy highlands to live, and became more and more
like horses.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">70</span>

<p>Some of the cat-like creatures went to the highlands, but they did
not go for the grass.</p>

<p>They were becoming more and more like tigers, and they went to hunt
the wild horses.</p>

<p>The timid horses ran when their enemies came, for there was no place
in which to hide.</p>

<p>When they ran they stepped on the tips of their toes.</p>

<p>They used the third toe so much more than the others that it became
larger and larger.</p>

<p>Its hoof became hard and strong.</p>

<p>The first and fifth toes were used so little that after thousands of
years they disappeared.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the horses had learned to run fast.</p>

<p>When a pack of wolves chased them, they galloped away.</p>

<p>They found rich grass on the highlands.</p>

<p>Colts grew to be larger than their mothers.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">71</span>

<p>By the time they were as large as ponies they used only the third
toe.</p>

<p>Two side toes hung like the dew-claws of a dog, but they did not
reach the ground.</p>

<p>When the Tree-dwellers lived, little bones beneath the skin were all
that was left to show where the side toes had been.</p>

<p>The hoof had become round and hard.</p>

<p>The wild horses ran very fast.</p>

<p>They outran all other creatures.</p>

<p>When surprised, they struck hard blows with their hoofs, and they bit
with their sharp teeth.</p>

<p>When they had enough to eat they liked to play.</p>

<p>One night as they were watching a herd of wild cattle, a&nbsp;young

night.</p>

<p>They slept until the break of day.</p>

<p>As they were rubbing their sleepy eyes, they heard a queer sound
close&nbsp;by.</p>

<p>“What is that?” said Bodo.</p>

<p>The boys listened.</p>

<p>All was still.</p>

<p>But they were sure that some animal was near.</p>

<p>There was a clump of alders within a stone’s throw.</p>

<p>Perhaps a bear was hiding there.</p>

<p>The boys were eager to find out, but they knew better than to rush
into danger.</p>

<p>All was quiet.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing there,” said One-Ear.</p>

<p>Bodo knew better.</p>

<p>He noticed a hump among the leaves.</p>

them.</p>

<p>Each night they came home one by one.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">107</span>

<p>Sharptooth still had charge of the fire.</p>

<p>She ate wild roots that grew near.</p>

<p>She cracked nuts that she found in the trees close&nbsp;by.</p>

<p>She ate berries in a neighboring patch.</p>

<p>But she never went far away, and she never stayed away long.</p>

<p>The blueberries were now ripe, so she went to the patch.</p>

<p>How she wished she might stay a long time!</p>

<p>But as soon as she had eaten a few, she hurried home to the fire.</p>

<p>As she scrambled over the fallen trees, she broke off a handful of
bushes.</p>

<p>They were loaded with ripe blueberries.</p>

<p>She carried them home to the children.</p>

<p>She told the women and children about the patch.</p>

<p>They all wanted to go.</p>

<p>So they piled broken branches upon the fire.</p>

<p>Then Sharptooth told one of the women to stay at home and take charge
of the fire.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">108</span>

<p>The women left their babies and little children in charge of this
woman, too.</p>

<p>How disappointed the little children were!</p>

<p>They watched the women and older children until they had passed out
of sight among the trees.</p>

<p>Sharptooth led the way to the patch.</p>

<p>In a few moments they found it.</p>

<p>It was almost blue with berries.</p>

<p>The children ate as fast as they picked.</p>

<p>The women ate, too, for a while.</p>

<p>But they remembered their little ones at home.</p>

<p>So they picked heaping handfuls of berries.</p>

<p>They wanted to carry more berries, so hunted for something to hold
them.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">109</span>

<p>One woman had a rabbit skin.</p>

<p>The other women helped her fill it with berries.</p>

<p>About the same time that the musk sheep came from the north, another
strange animal appeared.</p>

<p>It was a huge creature.</p>

<p>Not one like it has lived for ages.</p>

<p>It was a woolly rhinoceros.</p>

<p>The big-nosed rhinoceros liked to live where it was warm.</p>

<p>It lived on the wooded hills before the Tree-dwellers did.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<p>The small-nosed rhinoceros liked the warm country, too.</p>

<p>It came from the south when the Tree-dwellers appeared.</p>

<p>But the woolly rhinoceros came down from the north.</p>

<p>It was able to live in the cold.</p>

<p>It had an inner coat of fine curly wool.</p>

<p>This coat kept it warm.</p>

<p>It had a coarse, hairy outer coat.</p>

<p>This coat kept it from feeling heavy blows.</p>

<p>It had two horns on its ugly snout.</p>

<p>They kept it safe from harm.</p>

<p>When it was not disturbed it was a peaceable animal.</p>

<p>But when it was attacked there was no animal that was more
fierce.</p>

<p>The other animals learned to let it alone.</p>

<p>Sometimes the wolves and hyenas frightened it over a precipice.</p>

test of a book is the service it can render. The character of the
service demanded by it is determined by the needs of those to whom it is
devoted. This book was not written for the child of five or six years,
although children of that age have shown an interest in it. The child of
five or six is absorbed in the activities of his own home and his
immediate environment. His own neighborhood may well constitute the
chief source from which to draw the subject-matter in these early years.
Even though many of the processes that he observes are complex, it
matters little to the child at this time; for so easily do they lend
themselves to dramatic play that they cause him little difficulty. The
child at this time, therefore, has no need of this book.</p>

<p>But there comes a time when the ideal and the real world begin to
separate. No longer content with a “make-believe” process, and unable to
control the complex processes of modern life, he feels a need that
cannot be satisfied by the resources of his neighborhood alone. There is
need of looking elsewhere in order to find experiences that are
sufficiently related to his spontaneous activities to enlist his
attention, and sufficiently related to what is best in the society in
which he lives to form legitimate subject-matter for this period of
development. The materials which constitute the subject-matter of this
book have been selected and arranged with reference to the needs of the
child at such a time. It is the child of six and a half or seven years
for whom this book is intended.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">133</span>

<p>Were it not true that so many books that are written for children
have little regard for real facts, it would seem unnecessary to state
that in no case has material been introduced into this book which cannot
be justified by reference to a recognized authority in anthropology,
paleontology, or geology. The story-form by means of which these facts
are conveyed is merely a literary device for bringing home to the child
the truth that has thus far been ascertained regarding the fundamental
steps in the development of our industrial and social institutions.</p>

<p>The portrayal of the situation which caused our early forefathers to
rob birds’ nests and kill young animals will no doubt shock the
sentimentalist who orders eggs or veal as a matter of course. There
might be good ground for his feeling were there not present in the child
the instinct to do similar deeds even though living under social
conditions that do not justify such acts. Any one who will take the
trouble to recall his own childhood, or to make the acquaintance of
children of six and a half or seven years, will realize that such
instincts are present, and that they must find expression in one form or
another. Is it wise to ignore the facts of the case and allow the child
to form the habit of gratifying his blind instincts, or shall we
recognize the situation and meet it with all the wisdom at our command?
Is it not the better plan to tell the child frankly of the way in which
people lived at the time when they did what he would like to do now, and
lead him to discover the changes that have taken place that lead us to
disapprove of actions which, under different conditions, were considered
good?</p>

<p>The teacher who knows that she has good ground for her convictions is
not afraid to look upon a question from all sides. The fact that the
teacher is willing to look at a question from the child’s point of view
is a means of establishing sympathetic relations between her and the
child, who thus becomes willing to look at the question from the
teacher’s point of view. A&nbsp;sounder morality can be developed by
honestly facing the facts with the child and by
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
giving him the benefit of a broader experience, than by leaving him to
face the situation alone in the light of but part of the facts. The
problems with which the child at this time is grappling are so similar
in character to those of the race during the early periods of its
development that they afford the child a rich background of experience
suited to his own needs. The successful solution of these problems is as
important with reference to the development of the individual to-day as
then in determining the welfare of the race. A&nbsp;firm basis for the
development of the intellectual, the moral, and the physical life can
thus be laid at this time by a wise use of the experiences of the race
when it was laying the foundations upon which our civilization rests. It
must be remembered that there is as wide a difference between the real
situation in the hunting life and the scenes depicted in this book as
there is between the real attitudes of primitive people and those of the
child, which are idealized forms of the same attitudes.* The child would
shrink in terror from the real conflict. His interest is in the
dramatized form. If this dramatic interest of the child is satisfied, it
can be made to pay tribute to the sciences and the arts. If it is
ignored or repressed, it is liable to find expression in acts of
cruelty.</p>

METHOD</a></h5>

<p>The subject-matter is presented with the view of economizing the
energy of the teacher as well as that of the child. The attempt has been
made to base each lesson upon the experience of the child or at least
upon that which he may be enabled to experience if he has not yet done
so. This experience is so treated as to secure problems for advance
thought. The purpose of “<i>Things to Think About</i>” is to awaken the
<i>inquiring attitude</i>. It is at this point of the lesson that the
child is given the opportunity he prizes so highly of telling what he
has seen, heard, or done. Here he meets
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
with the new problems which compel him to reconstruct his experiences.
The printed questions, which map out the main features in the
development of the lesson, should be discussed freely. Care should be
taken to avoid mechanical answers. It is much better to leave questions
unsettled, or to leave the subject with several different solutions that
the different children have worked out, than it is to secure uniformity
by imposing upon the child the judgment of the teacher or of the author
of the text. In case of a necessary delay in answering a question on
account of a lack of related experience, the teacher should use the
means that are available for supplying the child with the necessary
experience. If the printed questions are discussed before the story is
read there will be less danger of a mechanical use of the book than
might arise from the habit of reading the story first and making answers
to the questions so as to fit the story.</p>

<p><i>The Story.</i> The function of the story is to supply the child
with racial experiences that will enrich his own more narrow personal
experience. It is not intended merely to please but to <i>present
facts</i> in a form which the child can understand. By using the simple
form of a sequence of sentences, each sentence standing by itself, less
difficulty is presented to the child in reading than if the paragraph
form had been employed. The greater ease with which the young child
reads this style, together with the fact that the rhythm in a majority
of the stories is of a character in keeping with the subject, and
readily appreciated by the child, seem to justify the use of this style
for a few months of the child’s life.</p>

<p><i>Things to Do.</i> The teacher should use her judgment in regard to
how many of these suggestions it is best to carry out in the school
hours. In schools where little work has yet been done in pantomime,
drawing, modeling, and other kindred modes of activity, it will probably
be the better plan to have many of the suggestions carried out in hours
of play. If the teacher takes an interest in what the child does outside
of school hours as well as in what he does in regular recitation and
work periods, and if she utilizes the
<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
experiences of the child that are gained in informal ways, she will have
no difficulty in securing the heartiest coöperation in the work of the
school. Where constructive work has already been introduced, the teacher
will have no difficulty in selecting from the suggested activities those
that are best adapted to her purpose. She should always feel free to
substitute for any of the printed suggestions others that may more
nearly meet the needs of the child in the locality in which she
lives.</p>


<h5><a name = "sugg_activity" id = "sugg_activity">
TYPICAL MODES OF ACTIVITY</a></h5>

<blockquote>
“If there is one principle more than another upon which all educational
practice, not simply education in art, must base itself, it is precisely
in this: that the realization of an idea in action through the medium of
movement is as necessary to the formation of the mental image as is the
expression, the technique, to the full play of the idea itself.”
&mdash;<i>John Dewey.</i>
</blockquote>

<p><i>Gesture and Pantomime.</i> The muscular sense is the foundation
sense from which all the others have been derived. Perceptions through
sight and hearing are uncertain, often requiring to be verified by the
use of the muscular sense or even by the use of smell or taste.
Knowledge gained through the use of sight and hearing may be
superficial; that which comes through the use of the muscular sense is
wrought into the very fiber of one’s being.</p>

<p>Among the more simple modes of using the muscular sense are gesture
and pantomime. They are within the reach of every teacher. They require
no materials. A&nbsp;worthy idea and the desire to communicate it are
the essential conditions for profitable work. Gesture and pantomime are
too powerful tools in education to be used carelessly. The teacher
should aid the child in discovering the real motive which animated the
character to be represented. She should appeal to the best in the child.
In so doing she will be able to use gesture and pantomime in such a way
as to transform activities, which when undirected are liable to
degenerate into vicious habits, into activities of great moral
significance.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<p>Teachers who have tried gesture and pantomime as a preparatory step
to other modes of activity have found it invaluable as a means of
securing a genuine growth of imagery and free expression in a variety of
forms.</p>

<p><i>Play.</i> It is now well known that many of the child’s
spontaneous plays are idealized reproductions of the serious activities
of primitive people. It is possible to make a much larger use of these
plays than has yet been made. It is hoped that the suggestions that are
scattered throughout the pages of this and the succeeding volumes of
this series will enable the teacher to make a large use of this most
important educational force.</p>

<p><i>Sand Modeling.</i> Almost every child has had experience in sand
modeling before coming to school. The part of the teacher is to enable
him to make use of this habit with reference to new ends. One who has
not learned through experience the value of this art is scarcely in a
position to realize what a stimulus it is to the growth of definite
images of geographical forms. When based upon observation, as it always
should be, it is unsurpassed as a mode of developing and communicating
adequate conceptions of topographical features. Sand pans should be
provided so that there will be at least one pan for every two children.
If each child can have a pan, the conditions will be still more
favorable. Whether sand pans are available or not, every primary
school-room should be supplied with a large sand box&mdash;two or three
if there is room for them. Excellent results have been attained in many
schools by modeling typical areas and representing in a graphic way the
life of the place. If the sand box is lined with zinc, rivers and lakes
may be represented with ease. In case there is no zinc lining, water may
be represented by the use of tin foil, or by glass which may be laid in
the bottom of the box, leaving only such portions uncovered as are
needed in order to represent the water. Moss, twigs, grass, stones, toy
animals&mdash;all help to make the scene more lifelike. By sprinkling
the sand with lime water it hardens so as to keep its shape for a long
time.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">138</span>

<p><i>Clay Modeling.</i> Although clay does not respond so quickly to
the touch as sand, it preserves its shape more easily. The more skill
that the teacher has in clay modeling the more freedom she will feel in
the work, but she should not hesitate to make use of this mode of
expression even though she has to learn with the child. The aim is not
so much to secure finish in details, or a result similar to that reached
by other people, as it is to secure the growth of the image and freedom
in expression. Only by leading the child to compare the result of his
work with the image in his mind does the image grow. By so doing, and by
referring to the real object when present, the child gradually gains
control over this mode of acquiring and communicating ideas.</p>

<p>It costs but little to supply a class with clay, for the same
material may be used again and again. It is desirable, however, to have
a sufficient supply to permit the preservation of the best work for some
time. Clay may be bought ready mixed at art stores and in kindergarten
supply stores. The common gray clay costs two or three cents a pound.
Artists’ clay costs five cents a pound. A&nbsp;cheaper kind can be
obtained of manufacturers of sewer pipes. The teacher will find
suggestions regarding the use of clay in Frye’s <i>Child and Nature</i>,
pp. 36-8; Kellogg’s <i>Forty Lessons in Clay Modeling</i>; Prang’s
<i>Art Instruction in Primary Schools</i>, First Year, pp. 27-39, Second
Year, 32-43; and in Kate Douglas Wiggin and Nora A. Smith’s <i>Froebel’s
Occupations</i>, pp. 32-43. Excellent articles illustrated by the work
of children appear in <i>The University Elementary Record</i>, which is
published by the University of Chicago Press, Chicago.</p>

<p><i>Basketry.</i> The materials of which baskets are made are less
pliable than clay or sand, yet the child of seven is able to manipulate
some of them. Where possible he should be encouraged to exploit his
environment in the search for raw materials that are adapted to this
purpose. In many localities tough grasses, willows, rushes, or other
pliable materials are present, and even though the child finds little
that is adapted to the purpose, the mere search for
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
materials enables him to appreciate the value of the commercially
prepared ones and aids him in picturing these materials in their raw
state. The pleasant days of autumn should be used for collecting such
supplies as are available at that time. These may be prepared for use
and stored until they may be needed later in the year. If the child
makes a ball of braided grass he will find many ways of using it later
in making baskets, mats, cradles, sandals, or anything which he may
choose to make of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Where natural materials cannot be obtained, commercially prepared
ones may be substituted. Raffia, uncolored or colored with vegetable
dyes, rattan reeds, and splints may be obtained wherever kindergarten
supplies are kept, as well as in large seed stores and in most of the
department stores in large cities. Of the many books that are appearing
upon the subject probably none is more suggestive with reference to the
significance of the art than George Wharton James’s <i>Indian
Basketry</i>, and none more helpful with reference to mastering the
processes than Mary White’s <i>How to Make Baskets</i>.</p>

<p><i>Drawing and Painting.</i> Since these arts were originally derived
from gesture language, it is not strange that gesture and pantomime are
the best means of preparing the child for these modes of communication.
The child who has difficulty in expressing his image by means of drawing
and painting should be given the opportunity to experiment by means of
pantomime until his image has become so clear that he can express it in
a less real way. Few children fail to draw and paint reasonably well
when afforded this opportunity that should be denied to none. In order
to secure the best results the teacher should be careful not to repress
spontaneity by criticising too severely; on the other hand she should
induce the child to make such comparisons of his work with his image and
with the object when present, as to prevent the formation of careless
habits of work. Although water colors are used in some schools, such
materials present more difficulties than it seems worth the while for
the child to encounter. More satisfactory results have
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
thus far been reached by the use of blackboard crayon, colored crayon,
and charcoal.</p>

<p><i>Language.</i> When the child talks about what he has experienced,
his language is almost invariably simple and direct. The lessons in this
book afford ample opportunity for the use of the fundamental forms of
language in communicating actual experience. Many of the stories may
well be supplemented by stories that the child tells himself. Care
should be taken, however, to keep the child within the limits of what
was possible during the age to which his story refers. Much benefit is
derived from allowing the children of the class to dramatize a story
after they have read it and represented it by means of pantomime.
Although there is ample room for written work, it is <i>oral</i> rather
than written language that should receive emphasis at this time.</p>

<p><i>Field Lessons.</i> The geographical phases of the work are
referred to so frequently throughout the text as well as under the
special suggestions for each lesson, that little need be added at this
time except to emphasize the fact that the teacher should make use of
every opportunity to cultivate in the child an intelligent interest in
his natural environment. Perhaps nothing will contribute more toward
developing this interest than field lessons. The value of these lessons
will depend upon whether an adequate motive is aroused in the child for
taking the trip and upon whether he is given the opportunity to make use
of the experience gained in a practical way. There are schools in
crowded quarters of large cities where it does not yet seem practicable
to take an entire class out on a field lesson. But it is always feasible
to make use of informal observations that the child makes from day to
day as well as the results of trips that have previously been taken by
some members of the class. During the time that this book is used it is
hoped that at least two or three of the following field trips or
excursions may be made:</p>

meadows to find&mdash;</p>

SUPPLEMENTARY FACTS</a></h5>

<p>The child asks many questions, some of which are difficult to answer.
Since what has been ascertained regarding the period during which the
Tree-dwellers lived is not contained in books that are generally
available, it has seemed best to present at this time such summarized
statements as will furnish the teacher with the facts that she may
need.</p>


<h5><a name = "sugg_animal" id = "sugg_animal">
ANIMAL LIFE</a></h5>

<p><i>Extinct Species.</i> Among the animals of the mid-Pleistocene
period that have since become extinct were the Irish deer; the
big-nosed, the small-nosed, and the woolly rhinoceros; the mammoth; the
cave-bear; and a sabre-toothed felis (<i>Machairodus latidens</i>),
sometimes, though incorrectly, referred to as the cave-tiger.</p>

<p><i>The Rhinoceros.</i> The big-nosed and the small-nosed rhinoceros
came to western Europe from the south. The former came the earlier and
stayed until the late Pleistocene period, when the later cavemen hunted
the reindeer. During this period it became extinct. As the climate
became severe, both species may have migrated south each winter. It
would have been possible, however, for them to remain, for they were
well adapted to a cold climate. It is interesting to know that many of
our popular tales of dragons originated in connection with the
discoveries of the huge bones of these creatures, which could be
accounted for in no other way.</p>

<p>Our information regarding these creatures is exceedingly meager. They
are characterized as dull-witted creatures with dim eyesight,
exceedingly impulsive and dangerous. They rarely attacked other animals,
for they lived upon vegetable food; but if they were molested they were
formidable creatures. At such times they would root up young trees with
their tusks, and pierce and rend the bodies of their most powerful
assailants. A&nbsp;full grown rhinoceros was seldom attacked by even a
mammoth or the
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
sabre-toothed felis. Its thick skin served as an impervious shield,
protecting it from the most powerful blows of the fiercest animals. It
is quite probable that packs of hyenas and wolves learned to take
advantage of precipices, and that they frightened the rhinoceros over
the brink, thus disabling him so that he became an easy prey.</p>

<p>The woolly rhinoceros came down from the north during mid-Pleistocene
times and was protected from the cold by a fine inner coat which
resembled wool, and a coarse hairy outer coat. This species was abundant
until the close of the Pleistocene period, when it became extinct. What
is stated above with reference to the characteristics of the rhinoceros
applies equally well to this species.</p>

<p>Very little has been written concerning these extinct species that is
satisfactory for the teacher’s use. Brief accounts can be found in
Hutchinson’s <i>Extinct Monsters</i>, p.&nbsp;225; in Stanley Waterloo’s
<i>The Story of Ab</i>, p.&nbsp;71; and in an article by E. D. Cope on
“Extinct American Rhinoceroses,” in <i>The American Naturalist</i>, Vol.
XIII., 771a.</p>

<p><i>The Mammoth.</i> Professor Owen, the eminent paleontologist,
writes: “The mammoth is better known than most extinct animals by reason
of the discovery of an entire specimen preserved in the frozen soil of a
cliff at the mouth of the river Lena in Siberia. The skin was clothed
with a reddish wool, and with long black hairs. It is now preserved at
St. Petersburg, together with the skeleton.”</p>

<p>The mammoth was not so large as it has sometimes been pictured. The
largest was not more than thirteen feet high, and many were not higher
than nine or ten feet. Its body was heavier than that of the elephant,
and its legs were shorter. It had enormous tusks, which it is thought
were sometimes used as crowbars in rooting up young trees in order to
get the branches for food. It is thought that several mammoths
coöperated in this work. Professor Owen writes: “The tusks of the
extinct <i>Elephas <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘primegenius’">primigenius</ins></i>,
or mammoth, have a bolder and more extensive curvature than those
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
of the <i>Elephas Indicus</i>. Some have been found which describe a
circle, but the curve being oblique, they thus clear the head, and point
outward, downward, and backward. The numerous fossil tusks of the
mammoth which have been discovered and recorded may be ranged under two
averages of size, the larger ones at nine feet and a half, the smaller
at five feet and a half in length. The writer has elsewhere assigned
reasons for the probability of the latter belonging to the female
mammoth, which must accordingly have differed from the existing elephant
of India, and have more resembled that of Africa, in the development of
her tusks, yet manifesting an intermediate character of smaller size. Of
the tusks assigned to the male mammoth, one from the newer tertiary
deposits in Essex measured nine feet ten inches in length, and two feet
five inches in circumference at its thickest part.” Mammoth tusks are
collected in Siberia as an article of commerce. The ivory is little
altered.</p>

<p>From the examination of the contents of the stomach of a mammoth that
was found frozen in a marsh it has been proved that the mammoth ate not
only the buds, cones, and tender branches of trees, but the wood itself.
Professor Owen shows that the mammoth was independent of the seasons on
account of being able to live upon such a diet. The teeth of the
mammoth, one of which weighs seventeen pounds, were well adapted to
grinding food that was hard and tough.</p>

<p><i>The Cave-Bear.</i> The cave-bear differed from the grizzly of
to-day chiefly in its greater size and strength. An interesting story of
the cave-bear is found in Stanley Waterloo’s <i>The Story of Ab</i>,
Chapter XXII. Ernest Thompson Seton’s “Biography of a Grizzly,” in
<i>The Century Magazine</i>, Vol. LIX., pp.&nbsp;27-40, will be
interesting to read in this connection.</p>

<p><i>The Sabre-toothed Felis</i> (<i>Machairodus latidens</i>). This
animal has usually been spoken of as the cave-tiger, but Professor
W.&nbsp;Boyd Dawkins has shown that it was no more closely allied to the
tigers than to other felines, and that “the very tempting name of
‘sabre-toothed
<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
tiger’ must therefore be given up as implying a relationship that does
not exist. It differs from the genus <i>Felis</i> in the enormous
development of the serrated upper canines, as well as the presence of a
third lobe on the sectorial edge of the upper premolar.” It was a
peculiarly destructive animal, its teeth being described as “uniting the
power of a saw with that of a knife.” The canine tooth of this animal is
the most perfect instrument for piercing and dividing flesh known. It
belonged to the southern group of mammalia; and, as the winters became
cold, it probably migrated each fall. Although it was never abundant it
was much feared. Remains of similar animals have been found in the
United States mingled with the bones of the mammoth.</p>

<p><i>Living Species.</i> Of the living species there were present in
mid-Pleistocene times, the brown bear, the grizzly bear, the wolf, the
fox, the stag, the roe, the urus or the wild-ox, the aurochs or European
bison, the hippopotamus, the horse, the wild boar, the beaver, the water
rat, the lion, sometimes spoken of as the cave-lion and being the same
species as the <i>Felis leo</i> of to-day, the lynx, the panther or
leopard, the wild cat, the spotted hyena, the otter, the musk sheep, and
the marmot. No animal was domesticated at this time.</p>

<p><i>The Urus.</i> The urus, which is the representative of the wild
cattle of this period, is the ancestor of our long-horned cattle, and
should be distinguished from the short-horned cattle that appear in
western Europe in the prehistoric period in a domesticated state. The
wild bulls were formidable antagonists when enraged. It is thought by
some that the Chillingham cattle are descendants of the urus. The color
of the urus is not known. Some think that it was white, but others doubt
that the species would have been able to survive with such a conspicuous
covering. On account of their fear of the beasts of prey the wild cattle
probably kept under cover of the trees during the day and went out to
the grassy uplands only when darkness came on. The feeding grounds of
the grass-eating animals determined the haunts of the beasts of
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
prey. When wild cattle are attacked, the larger animals in the herd
surround the younger and weaker so as to present a wall of horns to the
assailant. This habit is not peculiar to wild cattle, but is quite
characteristic of all grass-eating animals.</p>

<p><i>The Wild Horse.</i> The steps in the evolution of the horse are
stated so fully in the text that it is not necessary to repeat them
here. Almost any good text in geology gives the same facts. It should be
remembered that horses with more than one toe on each foot did not live
when the Tree-dwellers did, but during earlier periods. The teacher who
wishes to read further regarding the wild horse will find materials in
the <i>Century Dictionary</i> under <i>horse</i>, in <i>Chambers’
Encyclopedia</i>, in H.&nbsp;N. Hutchinson’s <i>Creatures of Other
Days</i>, in N.&nbsp;S. Shaler’s <i>Domesticated Animals</i>, and in
<i>McClure’s Magazine</i>, Vol. 15, p.&nbsp;512.</p>

<p><i>The Musk Sheep.</i> The appearance of the musk sheep in western
Europe during the mid-Pleistocene period marked the change that was
beginning to take place in the climate. As the climate increased in
severity all the arctic species came down from the north and occupied
the land during the late Pleistocene period. The musk sheep is the most
arctic in its habits of any of the herbivores, and at the present time
is restricted to the high latitudes of North America. It thrives in
desolate, treeless, barren grounds, not even being driven from its
haunts by the extremest cold. It is closely allied to the species which
is the parent of our domestic sheep, although that species did not
appear in western Europe until prehistoric times. The musk sheep goes in
herds of from twenty to thirty individuals, and when alarmed the animals
huddle together like frightened sheep. Its food is grass, lichens, moss,
and tender shoots of the willow and pine. It is much sought after for
its skin, which makes a fine robe. It is sometimes known as the musk ox
and occasionally as the musk bison.</p>

<p><i>Plant Life.</i> The characteristic trees of the mid-Pleistocene
period were evergreen. Of these the most abundant forms were the spruce,
the fir, and the yew tree. The trees which shed their
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
foliage were represented by the oak and the birch. The banks of rivers
were shaded by thickets of laurel and by the sloe, the original form of
the wild plum tree. The marshes afforded rich pastures for grass-eating
animals as well as hiding-places, for they were partly covered by a
heavy growth of alders. Wild peas, beans, stringy-rooted carrots,
ruta-bagas, and turnips grew on the hillsides. The cabbage with its
thick leaves, which had not yet developed into a head, was present.
Seeds of grasses were available, but not used, for man had not yet
learned to gather them and convert them into nourishing food. The
teacher may be interested in referring to Candolle’s <i>Origin of
Cultivated Plants</i> and Darwin’s <i>Plants and Animals Under
Domestication</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lesson I.</i> The child has the right to know what the book that
he is beginning to read deals with. This lesson is an attempt to answer
the question that naturally comes to his mind when opening the book. It
is hoped that it will serve as a means of enabling the child to gain a
clearer insight into the practical activities presented in the following
pages than would be possible without a consciousness of the goal toward
which they tend. Although this
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
lesson embodies a great deal of the philosophy of life, it is a
philosophy that the child needs and one which he can readily understand
when presented in a simple form, and when related to his own experience.
Unless it arouses questions from the child it may be passed over
somewhat superficially at first, but referred to again and again as
occasions for its use present themselves.</p>

<p>Assist the child to get the real thought from the lesson by
conversing with him and encouraging him to converse with his parents and
friends regarding the way in which they lived when they were children,
and the improvements that have been made since then. Find out from what
countries the forefathers of the children of the class came originally,
and something of the way that they lived before they came to this
country. In this way the child will gradually see that what we have, and
what we know, we owe largely to the efforts of our forefathers who have
lived and worked for many long ages. If you can get the child to gain
even a slight appreciation of the privileges that he enjoys, and a
respect for honest labor, you will be doing a much-needed work.</p>

<p>This lesson should not be passed without noticing the meaning of
these three sentences: “<i>Each animal knew how to do one thing well.
But the people could do a great many things. They could remember, too,
what had happened before.</i>” These three sentences contain the key to
man’s superiority over the brutes. Man at this time had a mind, but he
was only beginning to use it. We have no other ground for thinking
ourselves superior to our forefathers, the Tree-dwellers, than this: We
live at a time when it is possible to take advantage of what has been
accomplished during many long ages. Were we deprived of the
opportunities thus presented, we should find it difficult to account for
any superiority.</p>

<p>Reference: Katharine E. Dopp, <i>The Place of Industries in
Elementary Education</i>, pp. 16-24.</p>

<p><i>Lesson II.</i> The two questions raised serve to show the child
that the Tree-dwellers needed some of the things that we need. We feel
the need of much that they did not have, but we, as well
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
as the Tree-dwellers, need food the most of all. Next to food we feel
the need of shelter, clothing, and means of protection.</p>

<p>The child is ready to understand that Sharptooth is a woman who
differs from women to-day chiefly in the fact that she did not have as
good an opportunity to learn. Help him to be alert to see the admirable
traits in Sharptooth’s character. If he wishes to have her described,
tell him that she was shorter and probably more thick-set than women of
to-day; that she probably walked with a bend at the knee; that her
forehead sloped backward; that her jawbones were large and strong, her
chin small, and that probably her hair was a reddish color. These points
were omitted from the lesson because they are not regarded as essential,
and their introduction might lead to many questions which the teacher
ought not to be expected to be able to answer. They are added here as a
help to the teacher who may be questioned concerning these points.
Should the teacher desire further information on this subject, she will
find it in the references given below.</p>

<p>In places where it is impossible for the children to go to an
uncultivated place, the teacher may substitute for the suggestions at
the close of the lesson other work. But she should in some way give the
child an idea of grassy plains, wooded hills, and dense forests. Unless
he has such an experience as this he will not be able to deal with the
problem of finding a place where the Tree-dwellers might have lived. The
teacher’s problem at the close of this lesson is the one that
constitutes the central thought of the next two lessons. It is this: How
can the child get such an experience as will enable him to select a
place where the Tree-dwellers might have lived? In these days of cheap
transportation there are few schools where it is not possible for some
of the children to visit places that are sufficiently wild to answer the
purpose. By making use of such experiences of the children in
uncultivated places as they have or they can easily get, and by
supplementing these by means of pictures, stories, and sand modeling,
very satisfactory results can be obtained.</p>

<p><i>Lesson III.</i> The problem of this lesson has already been
stated. The questions at the beginning of the lesson serve to help the
child to interpret what he has observed, or what has been illustrated to
him. The scene of this lesson need not be definitely located in space,
for this book is a generalized account of progress, not a description of
a particular locality. Should the teacher need assistance in getting a
more adequate notion of a river valley, she will do well to read the
following references, as well as the chapters on river valleys in any
good textbook on geography or physiography.</p>

<p><i>Lesson IV.</i> This lesson serves merely to bring out the striking
contrasts that the geographical features mentioned in the last lesson
present. The child can readily see why it was necessary for Sharptooth
to swing from branch to branch instead of walking on the ground.</p>

<p><i>Lesson V.</i> Although the father was always more or less attached
to the primitive group, it was the mother and child that constituted the
original family. Not until the development of the patriarchal system in
the pastoral stage of culture was the relation of the father recognized
as of as great importance as that of the mother.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<p>The data from which the part of the story that deals with the way in
which Sharptooth carried her baby was constructed was derived from the
practices of contemporary tribes in the lowest stages of culture. It is
a well-known fact that all young infants during the first few hours
after birth possess the power to grasp and to hang suspended by the
hands for several minutes.</p>

<p>Ch. Letourneau, <i>The Evolution of Marriage and the Family</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lesson VI.</i> This lesson is important as marking the beginning
of the textile industry. Undoubtedly the motive that prompted the first
weaving was the love of the mother for her child, and her desire to keep
it safe from harm. The materials were inevitably such as the immediate
environment could afford&mdash;vines, slender branches, or other fibrous
plants. The process at first must have been crude, but savage women very
early developed a skill in basketry that we are not able to find among
civilized peoples. By encouraging the child to think of the different
articles that he uses that were made by weaving, and by examining the
beauty of the work, he will be prepared to grasp something of the
significance of the simple act of Sharptooth, which was an expression of
the same kind of mother love which he enjoys, but which he accepts as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>Explain to the child that the Tree-dwellers did not have such music
as we have. But mothers as they held their babies in their arms would
gently sway back and forth, uttering a soothing sound. The little girls
will no doubt enjoy making such a lullaby in their hours of play.</p>

<p><i>Lesson VII.</i> If no child in the class knows what kind of banks
a river has at the drinking-places, and if there is no opportunity to
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
go to a brook or river to find out, do not state that the banks are low.
The fact presented in that way would be almost devoid of meaning. But
let the child model a river valley in the sand box or out on the
playground showing steep banks in places and in others banks that slope
gently. Then let him think of a herd of cattle feeding on the hillsides.
The cattle need water. Suppose that they come up to the steep banks. Can
they reach the water? How can the cattle get down to the stream? When
the cattle have found a good drinking-place will they be apt to come to
it again? By means of such questions as these the child can picture the
conditions and the relation of living creatures to them. Such knowledge
as this means something to him. He need not try to remember it, for it
is his.</p>

<p>Give the child plenty of time in reading the short sentences that
picture the cattle in the stream to allow him to actually see the
different steps in the process. By considering each point by itself, but
yet in relation to the preceding step, the child can get a vivid
picture. (For information concerning the wild cattle, see <i>The
Urus</i>, p.&nbsp;145.)</p>

<p><i>Lesson VIII.</i> This lesson is introduced to give the child a
faint suggestion of the struggle for existence among wild animals. It
also suggests something of the dangers to which the Tree-dwellers were
exposed. Pass lightly over these dark pictures and emphasize the fact
that it was possible even in those times for Sharptooth and her baby to
sleep safe from harm. In contrast to this wild life let the children
draw pictures that will illustrate the security and comfort of their own
homes.</p>

<p><i>Lesson IX.</i> If possible let the child visit a cave; if not, he
may take advantage of the tiny streams that may be seen everywhere after
a heavy rain or during the thawing of snow. A&nbsp;careful examination
of such a miniature stream will enable the child to get all the
experience he needs in order to understand the geographical phase of
this lesson.</p>

<p>Do not try to teach the child much more than he can observe
<span class = "pagenum">153</span>
regarding the way in which caves were formed. A&nbsp;much better
opportunity to teach him this lesson is presented later.</p>

<p>Ask the child why Sharptooth dipped up the water with her hand. Do
not be discouraged if some child thinks that she might have used a tin
dipper. It is only by discovering the misconceptions of the child that
we are able to correct them.</p>

<p>The language of the Tree-dwellers was probably in a very undeveloped
state. That fact is merely suggested in the story.</p>

<p><i>Lessons X. and XI.</i> The first of these lessons conveys the
truth that people have taken many suggestions from animals in order to
better their condition in life. This does not imply that man is inferior
to the animal, but merely that he is inferior in some one respect, or
that he depends less upon instincts and thus has a greater need of
training. If the child learns at this early stage that there is no
person or no creature too insignificant to teach him something, he will
have learned one of the most valuable lessons in life. The child may not
be able to tell why the wild hog has lost its tusks, but he will enjoy
thinking about it. He can observe or find out in other ways that the
domesticated hog no longer has them, and by comparing the difference in
the mode of life of the animal in the wild and in the domestic state he
can see that the wild hog needed tusks and used them, while the domestic
hog of to-day does not have them. Children are so keen in their thought
that they can soon get the relation that exists between the use of an
organ and the state of its development. This point, introduced here,
paves the way for the lesson of the wild horse.</p>

<p>Let the children represent by pantomime the way in which the wild
hogs protected their young.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XII.</i> The only point that is liable to need explanation
here is the fact that Sharptooth required Bodo to take care of himself
when he was only a child. This can be more easily understood if it is
taken into consideration that mothers frequently had another child to
take care of at that time, and so of necessity
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
were obliged to let the older child take care of himself. The fact that
Sharptooth took pains to teach Bodo all that she knew, and that she left
him only when he was able to take care of himself, justifies the act
sufficiently. The slow development of father love is less easy to
explain and will not be attempted at this time.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XIII.</i> Read the general suggestions, pages 133 and 134,
before attempting to teach this lesson.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XIV.</i> Supplement this lesson by facts which the child
has observed regarding bees, or by pictures and stories that are almost
universally available.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XV.</i> Wild horses usually associate in large herds
sometimes numbering several hundred. This large herd is subdivided into
several smaller herds, each of which is led by the handsomest and
strongest stallion of the group. The younger and smaller horses keep on
the outskirts of the herd.</p>

<p>If the paper animals which the children cut are mounted in groups
upon the blackboard or on a large sheet of manilla paper it will greatly
add to the vividness of the child’s image. (See <i>The Wild Horse</i>,
p.&nbsp;146.)</p>

<p><i>Lessons XVI. and XVII.</i> The fact that we possess the records
which reveal the story of the evolution of the wild horse while the
complete account of many other species is not yet made, accounts for the
frequent allusions to the horse when discussing the history of physical
development. Read the suggestions here offered and as much of the
suggested reading as possible before teaching this lesson. Notice that
the four-toed horse the size of a fox lived not when the Tree-dwellers
did, but at a much earlier period. It is not necessary for the child to
get a clear conception of the time required for the changes pictured in
these lessons. No adult can have a perfect conception of this. But even
the child can get an <i>idea of development, of change</i>, which will
prevent the formation of such static conceptions of life as are still
only too prevalent in many of our institutions of learning. (For further
information regarding the wild horse, see p.&nbsp;146.)</p>

<span class = "pagenum">155</span>
<p><i>Lessons XVIII. and XIX.</i> Before the child is able to use tools,
he deals with objects through a direct use of the various organs of his
body. No better preparation can be given the child for an intelligent
use of tools and machinery than to let him practice a great variety of
activities that furnish him with the muscular sensations necessary to
interpret the more complex processes.</p>

<p>Encourage the child to collect natural forms in wood, stone, bone,
horn, shells, and other materials that may be available, and preserve
the best of them, thus forming the nucleus of an industrial museum.</p>

Elementary Education</i>, pp. 19-21, 32, 33, 134-140; “Some Steps in the
Evolution of Social Occupations,” III., <i>The Elementary School
Teacher</i>, March, 1903.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XX.</i> The purpose of this lesson is to show the way in
which man began the conquest of the animal world. Lead the child to see
that it has taken a long time to make the earth a good home for man, and
that one reason why we can learn more than the lower races knew is
because they spent their time in making the earth a better place in
which to live. (See pp. 147-148.)</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXI.</i> This lesson is based upon well-authenticated facts
supplied by Professor Boyd Dawkins. It portrays not merely the
intelligence of animals, but man’s alertness to take suggestions. It
also suggests to the child a relation that exists between him and the
larger world to which he is already looking with expectancy. (See
<i>Supplementary Facts</i>, pp. 142-144, for information regarding the
rhinoceros, the mammoth, and the sabre-toothed felis.)</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXII.</i> This lesson, together with the two following, in
which the probable method of subduing fire is portrayed, marks the
climax of interest in the story of the Tree-dwellers. No greater
conquest has ever been made. In writing of this subject, Mr. Geiger
says: “And if we admire in genius not only superior intellectual
endowment but the boldness of attempting to think of what has never been
thought of by any one before, and to undertake
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
what has never been done before, it was surely an act of genius when man
approached the dreaded glow, when he bore the flame before him over the
earth on the top of the ignited log of wood&mdash;an act of daring
without a prototype in the animal world, and in its consequences for the
development of human culture truly immeasurable.”</p>

<p>Only the first step in the conquest of fire is portrayed in this
lesson. That is <i>fear</i>.</p>

<p>References: Mason, <i>Origins of Invention</i>, Chapter III.</p>

<p>Katharine E. Dopp, <i>The Place of Industries in Elementary
Education</i>, pp. 22-24.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXIII.</i> This lesson shows how man, first through fear
and then through the desire to make friends with the dreaded object in
order to secure its protection, subdued fire. Its significance with
reference to social life is portrayed in this and in the following
lessons.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXIV.</i> The purpose of this lesson is to enable the child
to see the way in which simple societies were formed, the necessity for
the division of labor, and an early, if not the earliest, form of
worship. This lesson also illustrates a step in advance in the
development of the primitive family.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXV.</i> This lesson illustrates the first efforts of man
to make a shelter. Previous to this he was protected by such shelters as
nature afforded. Now he begins to adapt nature’s gifts to his own needs.
The construction of the rude shelter illustrates what is probably the
second step in the evolution of the textile arts, the first being the
weaving of a cradle. In both cases the motive was undoubtedly the desire
on the part of the mother to protect her child.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXVI.</i> The suggestions in this lesson, together with
those under <i>Basketry</i>, pp. 138-139, are probably all that are
required.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXVII.</i> Let the child suggest other uses to which fire
might have been put than those named here. Let him also suggest other
ways in which food might have been cooked accidentally.
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
Encourage him to make a connected story which will embody what he has
thought. Lead him to discover some of the advantages that arise from the
use of cooked food.</p>

Occupations,” III., IV., <i>The Elementary School Teacher</i>, March and

<p><i>Lesson XXVIII.</i> The purpose of this lesson is to supply an
experience that will pave the way to an understanding of coöperative
action.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXIX.</i> This lesson illustrates the way in which leisure
hours were used so as to secure not merely recreation, but a training
for the Serious activities of life. The child will readily appreciate
the significance of the primitive dance, for it is closely related to
his own spontaneous play.</p>

<p>Reference: Katharine E. Dopp, <i>The Place of Industries in
Elementary Education</i>, pp. 25-34.</p>

<p><i>Lesson XXX.</i> This lesson explains one very important reason for
wearing ornaments. The child’s instinctive love of ornaments may be
utilized to train him in habits of industry just as easily as the same
process took place in the development of the race. Really beautiful
necklaces and bracelets may be made by children, if they take pains in
stringing seeds of various sorts in such alternations as to give
pleasing effects. It is worth the while to encourage the child to see
the beautiful in nature and to train him to adapt nature’s forms so as
to secure still more pleasing effects.</p>

<p>Reference: Katharine E. Dopp, <i>The Place of Industries in
Elementary Education</i>, pp. 25, 27, 115.</p>

<p><i>Lessons XXXI. and XXXII.</i> These lessons serve the purpose of
making the transition from the mild, equable climate which characterized
the early part of the mid-Pleistocene period to the colder climate of
the later part of the period. The early part is the age which is
characterized in this book. The later part will be treated in the next
book. (For information regarding the animals referred to, see
<i>Supplementary Facts</i>, pp. 143 and 146.)</p>

<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<p><i>Lesson XXXIII.</i> This lesson is intended to still further
satisfy the child regarding the questions which will probably arise in
his mind from the first, and which were partially satisfied then. The
attempt has been made in all cases where it has seemed possible, to
speak frankly and directly to the child. Had the aim been merely to
please him, to excite him by dramatic stories, it could have been done
in a much easier way. The simple and plain statements of fact have been
made so as to enable the child to <i>understand</i>. The suggested
activities, together with other normal forms of work and play, furnish
sufficiently rich emotional reactions. In the light of the racial
experiences embodied in the stories, these emotional reactions maintain
their normal function as the most powerful factor in the education of
the child.</p>
